+ TZBET68 - Wallplug Switch (Z-Wave Plus) (all types)

### Notes:
**TZ65**
The TZ65 needs to use polling to get the correct dim state of the output in certain situations.  
The is by default on 300 seconds (5 minutes).  
It is not recommended to put this below 60 seconds (1 minute),  
it might cause too much traffic.  
you can also manually update the state by just pressing the left switch  
You can turn it off (value: 0), if you only want/need to update the state manually
